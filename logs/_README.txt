The "logs" script folder is a directory where log files are stored. These log files typically contain records or messages generated by a software program or script. They serve the purpose of tracking events, errors, or important information related to the execution of the script. Logs are valuable for troubleshooting, debugging, and monitoring the behavior of the script, as they provide a historical record of its activities and any issues that may have occurred during its operation.
